# Project by Sammy Mawira Mwenda for a coding challenge

The project is a Laravel/React web app.

Inspired by the 2024 Ultra Miami ticket website I tried a similar concept where as opposed to adding multiple events the system Administartor can create different ticket tiers and types for the same event.
Tickets can sell out once all designated tickets have been purchased. The project is super simplke just to get started and needs a lot of work. The project covers the scope of its intended purpose.
